1) "Scope of Attention" is what causes you to look at a line and follow it
around all the way until the end of that curve/line / similarity.
2) Feed the AI with tonnes of images of clear objects. This will help it "train" the
V1 neurons to fully recognize lines , shapes, etc. It should learn to form all the
orientation filters automatically

We can't use patches that are too small as it will not produce meaningful result. 
We should go with 5x5.

3) After this we begin the method of finding a patch where similar orientation is found.
We encode the distance,angle,color between each found match, angle ,etc.  All that are 
encoded are the differences.




4) We boil it up the chain. 

5) This to be done across dimension of time too - where similarity of the object
across time becomes a factor too.
